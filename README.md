DUBAI REAL ESTATE FINDINGS
	
  Apartments are the most popular types of property. The average age of listing for apartments is 61 days, which is the third least, after Residential plots and Residential floors. Residential plot and Residential floor, however, have just 6 and 12 entries in the dataset, which is why they are not considered.  I checked the frequency of the property type by rent category. I found out that for apartments, the low rent category had the highest frequency with 23890, followed by the medium rent category with 19867. For Villas, the High rent category had the most frequency with 8399, followed by the medium rent category with 4183.
The low rent category for both Apartments and Villas sells the quickest, with a median of 44 and 48 days, respectively. The next in line is the medium rent category, with a median of 51 and 54 days. 
For Apartments, rents should be between 42,000 and 95,000 to meet the low and medium categories. Rents for Villas should be between 58,000 and 110,000 to meet the low and medium categories.
	The modes for bedrooms and bathrooms in apartments are 1 and 2, respectively. The median age of listing for a bedroom and two-bathroom apartment is the second least. These show they sell quickly. The modes for the low and the medium rent categories for unfurnished apartments are significantly higher than those of the furnished apartments. The mode for unfurnished apartments is higher than the mode for furnished apartments. This shows that unfurnished apartments are preferred to furnished apartments. The difference in the average age of listing between unfurnished and furnished apartments is low (a difference of 1), with 60 days for the furnished apartments and 61 days for the unfurnished.
	The average rents in May and June are 93469.74 and 93999.94, respectively. The median rents in June and May are 54574.5 and 55000, respectively. May and June showed the lowest rent prices throughout the year. Median and mean were both used to compare because of the presence of outliers in the rent column.  
	The most popular cities are Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah. Locations with the least average age of listing are Ajman Uptown, Al Juraina, Emirates Lake Towers, Turrfana, Al Qattara, Wadi Ammar, Al Gharb, Al Humrah, Al Qarayen, Bukadra. Most popular locations are: Al Reem Island, Jumeirah Village Circle(JVC), Downtown Dubai, Khalifa City, Dubai Marina, Business Bay, Muwailih Commercial, Mohammed Bin Zayed City, Al Raha Beach, Dubai Creek Harbour. 

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Invest in apartments, since they are the most popular, and are quick to sell.
2. A bedroom and two-bathroom apartment sells quickly.
3. The cost of these apartments should be between 42,000 and 95,000. 
4. The apartments should be unfurnished, because the prices for unfurnished apartments are significantly lower than furnished apartments, and the difference in the average age of listing for both unfurnished and furnished apartments is just 1 day. This shows that unfurnished apartments sell almost as quickly as the furnished ones.
5. Apartments can be bought in May and June, because the rent prices are the lowest at that time. 
6. Cities like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah are the best cities to sell these apartments.
